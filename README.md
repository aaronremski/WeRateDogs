# WeRateDogs
## Udacity Project 3

In this project, one will gather, assess, and clean data then act on it through analysis, visualization and/or modeling.
<br/><br/>
## Gathering
  1. Utilize WeRateDogs twitter archive file composed of 5,000 tweets created 08/01/2017.
  2. Tweet image predictions were made with a neural network. This file is downloaded from Udacity servers utilizing Requests library.
  3. Gather additional tweet data for the tweets archived in step one. Utilize Twitters API to acquire additional tweet info such as:
      a. retweet count
      b. favorites count
      c. anything else that's interesting.

## Assess
Import data into dataframes and review for abnormalities, errors, etc. & document what needs cleaning.

## Clean
For the project, only 8 quality issues & at least 2 tidiness issues must be resolved. Merge datasets where appropriate
