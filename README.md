# WeRateDogs
## Udacity Project 3

In this project, one will gather, assess, and clean data then act on it through analysis, visualization and/or modeling.
<br/><br/>
## Gathering
  1. Utilize WeRateDogs twitter archive file composed of 5,000 tweets created 08/01/2017.
  2. Tweet image predictions were made with a neural network. This file is downloaded from Udacity servers utilizing Requests library.

      a. retweet count
      b. favorites count
      c. anything else that's interesting.

## Assess
  * Import data into dataframes and review for abnormalities, errors, etc. & document what needs cleaning.<br/>
  * Extract data from tweet data from tweets & combine with archived data & image predictions. 
  * Determine 8 quality, & 2 tidiness issues.
  

## Clean
  * Merge datasets where appropriate. 
  * Clean quality & tidiness issues outlined in assessment stage
